# Event-Simulator

This is a discrete event simulation project which can be used to model many real-world systems such as queuing to order food at a fast-food restaurant. It can
* simulate the changes in the state of a system across time, with each transition from one state of the system to another triggered via an event
* track simulation statistics to measure the performance of the system
