# Event-Simulator

CS2030 (Programming Methodology II) is a CS module in NUS which explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming.

This is a discrete event simulation project which can be used to model many real-world systems such as queuing to order food at a fast-food restaurant. It can
* simulate the changes in the state of a system across time, with each transition from one state of the system to another triggered via an event
* track simulation statistics to measure the performance of the system
